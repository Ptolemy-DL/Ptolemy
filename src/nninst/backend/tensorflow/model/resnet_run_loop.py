    is_training: A boolean denoting whether the input is for training.
    batch_size: The number of samples per batch.
    shuffle_buffer: The buffer size to use when shuffling records. A larger

      time and use less memory.

      corresponding (image, label) pair.
    num_epochs: The number of epochs to repeat the dataset.
    num_parallel_calls: The number of records that are processed in parallel.
      This can be optimized per data set but for generally homogeneous data
      sets, should be approximately the number of available CPU cores.
    examples_per_epoch: The number of examples in the current set that
